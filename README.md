## Product Description  

NOVA AI is a web-based, AI-powered educational platform that establishes a strong and effective communication bridge between teachers, students, and parents. Built on the foundations of the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, it analyzes each student’s exam results, identifies knowledge gaps, and offers personalized learning strategies tailored to their individual strengths. This allows students to fill in their academic gaps using methods that best suit their unique learning styles, promoting long-term academic success.  

In today’s education systems, unlocking a student’s full potential requires more than just the transfer of information. NOVA AI combines personalized learning methods with transparent and real-time communication to achieve this goal. It not only guides students toward the most effective learning approaches but also enables teachers and parents to actively participate in the learning process.  

**NOVA AI transforms student achievement from a one-time result into a continuous and growth-focused learning journey.**
