  <summary><h2>Product Description</h2></summary>

NOVA AI is a web-based, AI-powered educational platform that establishes a strong and effective communication bridge between teachers, students, and parents. Built on the foundations of the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, it analyzes each student’s exam results, identifies knowledge gaps, and offers personalized learning strategies tailored to their individual strengths. This allows students to fill in their academic gaps using methods that best suit their unique learning styles, promoting long-term academic success.

In today’s education systems, unlocking a student’s full potential requires more than just the transfer of information. NOVA AI combines personalized learning methods with transparent and real-time communication to achieve this goal. It not only guides students toward the most effective learning approaches but also enables teachers and parents to actively participate in the learning process.

NOVA AI transforms student achievement from a one-time result into a continuous and growth-focused learning journey.

NOVA AI, öğretmen, öğrenci ve veli arasında güçlü ve etkili bir iletişim ağı kuran, yapay zeka destekli web tabanlı bir eğitim platformudur. Çoklu Zeka Kuramı temel alınarak geliştirilen altyapısı sayesinde, her öğrencinin sınav sonuçlarını analiz eder; eksik olduğu konuları belirler ve bireysel güçlü yönlerine uygun kişiselleştirilmiş öğrenme stratejileri sunar. Böylece öğrenci, kendi öğrenme stiline en uygun yöntemle eksiklerini tamamlayabilir ve akademik başarısını sürdürülebilir şekilde artırabilir.

Günümüz eğitim sistemlerinde öğrenci potansiyelini en üst düzeye çıkarmak yalnızca bilgi aktarmakla sınırlı değildir. NOVA AI, bu hedefe ulaşmak için kişiye özel öğrenme yöntemlerini, şeffaf ve gerçek zamanlı iletişimle birleştirir. Öğrencilerin doğru öğrenme yollarına ulaşmasını sağlarken, öğretmen ve velilerin de sürece aktif katılımını mümkün kılar.

NOVA AI, öğrenci başarısını anlık bir sonuçtan çıkarıp, sürekli gelişimi odağına alan bir öğrenme sürecine dönüştürür.

Sprint Review Participants:
Yağmur Kolancı , Emre Ayhan

Sprint Retrospective:

Although our team originally consisted of 5 members, only 2 were able to actively participate in the project during Sprint 1. The other 3 members were unable to contribute due to various reasons. As a result, we experienced communication and planning challenges at the beginning of the sprint.

Since we had to start the project later than expected, we were only able to finalize our product idea and begin working on July 5. Within this limited timeframe, we focused on selecting the platforms we would use for more effective project management.

📝 At the end of Sprint 1, we made the following decisions:
We will clarify responsibilities to strengthen team communication.

We will continue to develop the project consistently and adhere to proper sprint planning in the upcoming sprints.

We selected our project management tools (Trello/Asana) and started using them actively.

We will establish regular team meetings with fixed days and times to improve collaboration.

This sprint served as a preparation phase in which we finalized our idea and laid the foundation for the project. In the next sprint, we will focus on developing the first concrete parts of the product.
